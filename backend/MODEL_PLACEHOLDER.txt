# This is a placeholder for model.pkl
# 
# Please place your pre-trained CatBoost model (model.pkl) in this directory.
# The model should be exported using joblib and should accept the following features:
# 
# Features (in order):
# - height_cm (int)
# - weight_kg (int) 
# - best_position (categorical)
# - overall_rating (int)
# - potential (int)
# - preferred_foot (categorical)
# - weak_foot (int)
# - pace (int)
# - shooting (int)
# - passing (int)
# - dribbling (int)
# - defending (int)
# - physical (int)
# - age (int)
#
# Until you place the real model, the application will use a dummy model
# that generates realistic predictions for testing purposes.
